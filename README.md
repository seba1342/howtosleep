# About
How to Sleep is a project which is designed to inform users of how to get a better night's sleep. It was created in response to a University brief which required us to create a 'How To' guide.

# Technologies
To create this website I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
For the star effect in the header parallax image I used [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).
To handle the parallax scrolling of the header image I used [Rellax.js](https://github.com/dixonandmoe/rellax).
To host this site I am using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

# Development
To run the site locally clone the repository and navigate to its location in the command line. Run `npm install` and then `gulp dev` to see your changes automatically take effect as you develop. You must have gulp installed globally to use these features.
